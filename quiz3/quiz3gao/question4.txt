4- What is the difference between code-first approach and database approach in Entity
framework?

answer:
In code-first approach we will first create entity classes with properties defined in it. 
Entity framework will create the database and tables based on the entity classes defined. 
So database is generated from the code. When the dot net code is run database will get created.

In database first approach, Database and tables are created first. 
Then you create entity Data Model using the created database.

In question 1 and 2, we are using code-first approach.
